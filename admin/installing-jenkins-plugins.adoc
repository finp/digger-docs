== Installing Jenkins plugins
Digger will by default install a number of Jenkins plugins required for its proper operation. If more Jenkins plugins are required, they can be installed by including them in Ansible playbook or using the Jenkins UI.

NOTE: Plugins for Jenkins can be found at https://plugins.jenkins.io

=== Using Ansible Playbook
The `jenkins_plugins` parameter can be overridden to include new plugins. The
structure of a Jenkins plugin is as follows.

[source,yaml]
----
-
  name: sample-plugin
  version: 1.20
  archive: http://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/plugins/sample-plugin/1.20/sample-plugin.hpi
----

=== Using Jenkins UI
Go to `Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins`. If the plugin is not available in the
`Available` tab then it   can be installed by uploading an `.hpi` file in
`Advanced -> Upload Plugin`.
